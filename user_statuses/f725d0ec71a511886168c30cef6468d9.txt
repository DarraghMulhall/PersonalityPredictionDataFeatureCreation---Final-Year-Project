Sorry bud but it's still a nub. hahahahaha."I ain't gonna take my pants off!"."Come, let us gingerly touch our tips."."You white, then you *PROPNAME*k"."I will slaughter them like a wolf among lambs. The seas will run red with the blood of my enemies!" "No, I will have my cupcakes, piping hot from their forty watt womb." "That tears it how many times today will I have to hear the word womb?"."Are you saying my granny was a skank ass ho-bag?".*PROPNAME* is awesome..."complaining about going to the dentist is like complaining about too much education...it's offensive to Alaskans...To *PROPNAME*, I just got finished coloring your wife's book.".i want more sleep.<blank>."I don't have a girlfriend, but I know a girl that would be really mad if she heard me say that.".SLEDDING.
