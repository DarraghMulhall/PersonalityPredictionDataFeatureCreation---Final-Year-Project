is at work! >.<.must be insane for starting a twitter account.This is my face Covered in freckles With the occasional spot and some veins This is my body Covered in skin And not all of it you can see And, this, is my mind It goes over and over The same old lines And, this, is my brain It's torturous analytical thoug.is ready for school to start back... summer sucks when you aren't actually on vacation.realizes that she has friends on Facebook that she doesn't remember how she met... is that wrong? Discuss:.is reading Master and Fool, the convoluted finally to The Book of Words trillogy, in between playing stupid facebook apps... Such a Nerd. >.<.I, I'm thinking it's a sign That the freckles in our eyes Are mirror images, and when we kiss They're perfectly aligned And I have to speculate That God himself did make Us into corresponding shapes Like puzzle pieces from the clay.dealing with crazy people all day... A&A ppl: don't forget the lecture tonight! Not sure what it is about though... :P.>.<.will be in knoxville for break. >.<'.a;lkdhoarjenfpreoijn.Due to a lack of anyone being interested in my life updates, I will write here and delude myself that someone wiill read it later and actually care...  Got a new phone yesterday: a Palm treo.  Had to pay $30 a mo extra to use it, but now I'll be able to use the interwebz while in White Bluff.  30 dollars is a fair price to put on cabin fever prevention. Maybe I should Tweet this too. :P.*PROPNAME* made it up to me today... after I waited for her for a half hour past our appointment time. Sheesh. But *PROPNAME* was awesome enough to let me have some hot chocolate :).just got skype. name: ljacocke.
