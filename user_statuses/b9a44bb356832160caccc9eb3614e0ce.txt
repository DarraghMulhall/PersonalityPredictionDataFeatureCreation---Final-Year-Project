YAAAAAYYYY!!!!!!is ready for school to start back... summer sucks when you aren't actually on vacation.realizes that she has friends on Facebook that she doesn't remember how she met... is that wrong?

Such a Nerd. >.<.is creating a LinkedIn account, as if she didn't already have too many networking accounts to keep track of!I, I'm thinking it's a sign That the freckles in our eyes Are mirror images, and when we kiss They're perfectly aligned And I have to speculate That God himself did make Us into corresponding shapes Like puzzle pieces from the clay.is at work... yay.thinks she will keep this as her profile pic until those tan lines fade, if that ever happens.is stressed... but has great tickets for the game! row 1 baby!

I'll be happy passing with a C.hopes to have her drawings finished in exactly one week from now... let's see how THAT works out......?is inactive.is upset.  *PROPNAME* ditched our appointment I made, after I waited in the office for about an hour, and now I'll probably never get to talk to her.  I wish she'd actually do her job in stead of taking 5 hour lunch breaks then leaving early.... Bitch.is hungry.needs to suck it up.Due to a lack of anyone being interested in my life updates, I will write here and delude myself that someone wiill read it later and actually care...  Got a new phone yesterday: a Palm treo.  Had to pay $30 a mo extra to use it, but now I'll be able to use the interwebz while in White Bluff.  30 dollars is a fair price to put on cabin fever prevention. Maybe I should Tweet this too. :P.*PROPNAME* made it up to me today... after I waited for her for a half hour past our appointment time. Sheesh. But *PROPNAME* was awesome enough to let me have some hot chocolate :).is in Knoxilla for a few days. Trying to get this Germany thing settled. Still. Garg!just got skype. name: ljacocke.
