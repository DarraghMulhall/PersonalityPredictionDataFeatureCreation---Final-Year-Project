Thanks for all the mazal tovs // congratulations.  :-)."This is the day, come what may I'll still be saying this is the day." Loving camp!  :-).I've officially booked an October flight to New York to visit my future husband.  :-).I am thankful for webcams.  It is nice to be able to see my fiance online while he is in New York.  :-).Can't wait until Friday morning when I'll be in my fiance's arms.  :-).I am getting less and less sleep due to midterms.  :-(.I hate having laryngitis as a songleader.  I want to be able to do my job, but I can't.  :-(.Now that *PROPNAME* has returned to New York, I am finally working on completing my philosophy of Jewish education paper.  It is pleasant to do school work after two weeks of rest, relaxation, and fun.  :-).
