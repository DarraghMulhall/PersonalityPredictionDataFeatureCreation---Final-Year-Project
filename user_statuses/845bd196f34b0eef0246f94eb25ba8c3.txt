Yay!Am I the only person who got all teary-eyed during *PROPNAME*'s emotional speech?Is anyone else catching the disastrous wordspacing on the screenshot for iBooks? Why cant each book be typeset the way it was for print?YAAAAAAAAAAAY SAINTS!!!! New York is out so Im pulling for you!!Seriously I dont know how male dominated Apple is but "pad" has a whole different connotation for us ladies.It seems that Apple instead of creating a tablet Mac they created a big iPhone and one that doesn't seem to improve drastically on it. :(.Im so happy for the Saints!!!
