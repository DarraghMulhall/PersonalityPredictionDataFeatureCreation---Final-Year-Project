Like someone said,friendship s like a china..beautiful in itself,but once broken,will leave traces even if its glued back..reached my 500 limit in MAFIA..and continuing up... a special thanks to all mafia frends...coastin......;-).but the good thing is that today, i fired all my rounds .. so, i'll hav to drive to town to fetch the next set f cartridges today coz, u kno, ive got nothin else to do tomorrow.....obvously,if life goes like this,1K rounds per year limit is way too far that, it'll seem like a tiny dot....Unless a miracle happens, life s gonna be a rough ride ahead !!! . . .back.Holidays comin to an end...Back to action tomorrow.. Wish u all a prosperous year ahead..God Bless !!!!
