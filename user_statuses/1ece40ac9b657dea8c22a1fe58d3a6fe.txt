R.I.P MJ.You always knew just how to make me cry | And never did I ask you questions why | It seems you get your kicks from hurting me | Don't try to understand me | Because your words just aren't enough | Love is a feeling | Give it when I want it | Quench my des.missed teaching at the elementary school Thursday...  -sad-.wants to fall in love~."The greatest happiness is to scatter your enemy, to drive him before you, to see his cities reduced to ashes, to see those who love him shrouded in tears, and to gather into your bosom his wives and daughters.".I want to be loved, but you don't seem to love me | I'm wandering aimlessly within this repetition | And the answer I found is only one; that even if I'm scared, even if I'm hurt | I'll say "I love you" to the person I love."In the absence of orders, find something and kill it."   -*PROPNAME*."I have a ship and a fighting crew and a girl with lips like wine, and that's all I ever asked.  Lick your wounds, bullies, and break out a cask of ale.  You're going to work ship as she never was worked before.  Dance and sing while you buckle to it, damn you! To the devil with empty seas! We're bound for waters where the seaports are fat, and the merchant ships are crammed with plunder!".Like fire, Hellfire,  This fire in my skin.        This burning, desire,         Is turning me to sin.  | It's not my fault; I'm not to blame.   It is the gypsy girl; The witch who sent this flame  | It's not my fault; If in God's plan.  He made the devil so much stronger than a man.Slowly walking down the hall, Faster than a cannonball~  Where were you while we were getting high? Someday you will find me, Caught beneath the landslide, In a champagne supernova in the sky~~~.
