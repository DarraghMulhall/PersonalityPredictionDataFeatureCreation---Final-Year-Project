Love me Dead...Attention everyone: If you have the misfortune of reading this, then I regret to inform you that I've been seriously injured in a car accident. Okay, maybe not, but I did just lose the game....Desperately seeking room slash room mate. Can anyone help me out with any leads?Failing....the next best thing to succeeding.Anyone think they could help me out by escorting me to the airport Friday morning? I can pay in undying gratitude and awkward silences....Plan A officially scrapped. Good thing I have plan B right? Airportage at 5:45 in the am!If a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it, do you still lose the game?So. Zombieland: Great movie?......or the greatest movie?Back in the 813....the place to be!Would you like some failsauce to go with your epic fail?In Toronto! I'm getting my Canadian on!Back from vacation. Cruise was fun, but now I feel like I need a vacation from the previous vacation...Sick! I'm going to blame Northerners...why? Why not?So there's something about a Super...Bowl? On right now?So this is what it's like to be bored on a Saturday night...
