Awesome! ^^.just found an organization called Think Before You Speak that flips out about people saying, "that's gay," claiming that it's offensive.  That's pretty gay, if you ask me.                                                                                    .has only 8 more days to use the government's money.  Anyone want me to go run the water and waste some more of their money?  Got any grudges?   ;).stayed up to finish The Kite Runner last night, probably around four in the morning.  I'm not sure because I don't have a clock up there! lol.s little sister told her that she could "ride her tricycle with no handlebars."  As long as you don't start singing their more political songs, sweetie.  :P.just planned the perfect field trip. ^^.just got back from the zoo.  No gray wolves, no girraffes...really not much of anything.  :(.s mom can't find a cheap orange Jansport backpack online because *PROPNAME* used one in Twilight, so everyone's paying top-dollar for them.  Hilarious.  :D.is having fun learning the 12 Principles of Animation.  Also, I drove on a road for the first time yesterday.  Don't worry; it was just a few blocks, and everyone should be back on their feet in no time.  ;).s hamster died last night. :(.might need to make an easier "how-well-do-you-know" quiz.  Go take it and tell me.  ; ).can't get the freaking pictures on Facebook to work!  I hate that app! >:(.just filled out a survey to get monthly email coupons for ProPlan at Complete Petmart!

My back is splotchy again, and this time I didn't even use sunscreen!  >:(.finds it funny how absolutely Kung Fu Panda dominated the *PROPNAME* last year.  Even WALL-E didn't stand a chance!  (Oh, yeah, that's what *PROPNAME* was named after. ;).finally found her tea diffuser!  It's tea time, biyotch!  ...Hmm, am I allowed to say that?  Guess I'll find out when I'm grounded for a week...  ;).Really needs to plan out the next two days carefully... Hmm...  \AC_\AC.jumping on the lyrics-for-status bandwagon: Don't let apathy police the populace, we will march across those stereotypes that were marked for us. The answer's obvious; we switch the consonants and change the "sword" to "words" and lift continents.  9//11 <3.s weird cat came inside not for a bowl of food, but for a bowl of water.  I poured some water over near where he was outside and he came trotting over straight into my arms!  XD.WHAT?  WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME THAT ZOMBIELAND WAS FILMED AT WILD ADVENTURES?!  So those guys trying to recruit LHS students for a "big movie making fun of zombie movies filmed near WA and in the woods" were actually legit!  OMG I have to go see it! Also, all you people in Valdosta fail for not telling me about it! ;).can't believe how many restaurants and stores didn't have their flags at half-staff today!  How can you possibly forget what today is, especially if the building right next to you has theirs at half-staff?  9//11 <3.New cell number: (555) 555-5555.helps the police, because nice police are nice to me!
