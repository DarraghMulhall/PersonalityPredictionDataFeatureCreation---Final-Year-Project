is enjoying the cricket...comfy boxers and rainy weather...is it too soon for a beer?can't believe that her son walked up to the Christmas tree stating 'J'. I was a little confused until he took a candy cane off the tree and proceeded to turn it upside down :-D.got home from shopping all evening (*PROPNAME* and kids in tow) and then wrapped presents all night...and it still isnt finished...*yawn*.- so, this morning *PROPNAME* gets up to play and he goes over to the carpet where the light was shining through the blinds casting shadows...he then proceeds to tell me the different letters the sun is making on the carpet... 'I', 'T' and 'L' to be exact.needs beer...actually, any kind of alcohol will do...is sick of being sick!is enjoying the cricket but has no fingernails left.would like the rain back!had a great day yesterday thanks to aunties babysitting :0).I did the Macarena with a pickle at the dinner table because the voices told me to.So...*PROPNAME* can now count backwards from 10 :-).So...apparently, according to urban dictionary...A women named *PROPNAME* is typically very beautiful with an incredible body and nice eyes. They are known to be very loveable. *PROPNAME* are envied by other women...haha...I wish!
