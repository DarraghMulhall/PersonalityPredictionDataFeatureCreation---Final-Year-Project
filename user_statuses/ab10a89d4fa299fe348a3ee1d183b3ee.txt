I was totally freaked out tonight while driving home with Janice at 12am. The black coupe next to me matched my speed even though I was going fast and then he continued to match me speed as I slowed down. So I turn to look at the driver of the car and he's wearing a mask. A rubber mask reminiscent to freddy cruger. 0_0 I almost had a heart attack. I then slowed down a lot and he continued on... oh my goodness...In my 10 min stop at 85*C bakery in Irvine, I saw 4 people I knew...Then at Costco tonight, I find out my atm card is blocked due to potential fraud. Now I need to stop by the bank tomorrow for a temporary card... I wonder if this qualifies for fml...Quite possibly the worst couple days ever: yesterday almost cried at work. I apparently have the 2 worst classes in the school- lowest freshman math. Who I see for four periods.  And which stole a student's wallet.
