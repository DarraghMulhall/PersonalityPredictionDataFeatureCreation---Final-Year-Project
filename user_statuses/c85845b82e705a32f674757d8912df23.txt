I just added another $70 to my "um no dumby actually I don't owe you that money" total. Yay me:)."You try growing up in a trailer park with nothing but dust mites and Lithuanians and see where that gets you"..a line from a terrible movie on netflix on demand, but it made me giggle.Fantastic day of hanging out with friends and doing some shopping:) Relaxing on the couch reading for a bit.had a busy day.
