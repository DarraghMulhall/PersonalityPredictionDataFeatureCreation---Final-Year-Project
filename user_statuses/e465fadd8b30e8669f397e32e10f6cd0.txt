And you\92d better get to living" - *PROPNAME*."To take from one because it is thought that his own industry and that of his father's has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who, or whose fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association -- the guarantee to every one of a free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it."~*PROPNAME*.can't breathe out of either one of my "noses" (as my sister used to call them).well my first class was cancelled because the professor thinks her whole family has come down with H1N1, so I'm trying to be productive anyway....class, back to the apt. to pack, pickin' up a few necessities at Bass Pro, Dentist, then home for the weekend!! :).Also, Happy XXrd Birthday to my Mama!Oh my gee willikers----I do not like writing memos...So, just about everyone on my friend list is highly upset that it's Monday; but I know that once I get through this "9-6 in class + homework after that"  Monday, my week is nearly over...
