It's really irksome when a grad school application recognizes 'California Institute of Locksmithing' but not 'California Institute of Technology.'.I love how Techers are always tagged as "The Smart One.".Fun( baiting Russian trolls) > Fun( baiting generic trolls).What's this song I'm hearing on the radio with sirens, screams and gunshots?  Oh right, it's "Santa Claus is Coming to Town.".Stanford says no. :(.
