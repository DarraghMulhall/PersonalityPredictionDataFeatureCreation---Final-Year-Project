A sort anti-pollution, green peace statement 2. A light heart warming love story 3. AND WHAT NOT TO DO DO WHEN WE ACTUAL INVADE OTHER PLANETS :D.Finally found " *PROPNAME* and His Flying Robot " ... anybody remembers this series.Saw 3 idiots.. It was refreshing. Even though it appered to me as more of a commentary on  our education system.  However, it painted a fairly black'n white picture.  But then .. its just entertainment :).East Lansing : -16 C (feels like) Pullman : -10 C (Feels like).Heard *PROPNAME* after a long time.  Took me back to my ol' school and undergrad  days.Watching K-pax and njoying every momemnt of it.
