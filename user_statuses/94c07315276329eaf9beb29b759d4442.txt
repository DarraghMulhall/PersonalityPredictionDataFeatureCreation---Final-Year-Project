New Year's resolutions... why wait until January? Screw that, December is MY month! I will exercise daily. I will not fall asleep randomly without brushing teeth (eww). I will clean my room weekly. I will not save files with names like 'adsvdsq.' I will finish all tasks by 75% of the deadline. And for motivation, I will move $100 from my checking to my savings account each time I fail! Go go self-improvement!Baking in my room. TT.Yay! Left my flash drive inside a computer in a PACKED math lab yesterday. Called the office today and asked them to check and it was still there!
