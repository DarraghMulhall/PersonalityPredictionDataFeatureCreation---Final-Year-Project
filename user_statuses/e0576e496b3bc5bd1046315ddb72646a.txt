House rocks, and when he comes back in two weeks we will see how much worse the crazy people are when House goes at them.is excited that he was able to perdict the weather by properly interperting satilite imagery!!WINS! take that MalMal.is going to be full of himself for no real reason for the next couple of hours. He also made really good chocolate chip cookies, from scratch by hand.just got a shot in his ass for his headache, that works like how he imagines works like Vicodin for House's leg. Minus the addictive part that is.

It left a note saying it should be back around 11 am tomorrow.s head would explode if his skull wasn't being hammered on by numerious sledge hammers. needless to say my headache has decided over the counter painkillers only make it more angry."... and then I have a witty response." -House.I'm on call, to be there."Its only illegal if you get caught, assuming you're stupid enough to get caught in the first place".feels the need to say something deep and profound, but its very late and he is tired from his workout today. With those conditions this is the best he's got.does all his status updates in 3rd person. This will likely never change.is exhausted, stressed, and is having an awarding winning bad luck streak in terms of things going his way. But for whatever reason was nominated for the homecoming courts.is tired and probably sick but likes to stay positive and think its just allergies(pretty sure thats spelled wrong too). But had an amazing time at a murder mystery party being the main investigator, and was close to getting the right answer but didn't have enough information. He also intends to finish polishing an essay for english that is way longer than any essay really has the right to be.just washed a paper plate so that he could use it for something else. It would have been easier to just grab a new one right next to him.has probably, most likely, lost what ever symbolance of a mind he once held."she only drinks coffee at midnight. when the moment is not right, and her timing is quite, unusual.".made the most amazing burritos for dinner and feels sad that he can't finish them and enjoy their great deliciousness anylonger...6k+car break down+friday the 13th=me feeling superstious. 6k=fail=me tired.is awsome.

(If any of you get the extreeeemly geeky reference I'm making, just smile and accept that every year i wish for Firefly to start up again)(Hint, Hint, Santa).I harbor a strong distaste for 6ks.1 honest answer. you can ask me one question (send it to my inbox ) any question. NO matter how awkward it can be, I'll answer it honestly. There's no catch but I dare you to post this as your status and see what people ask you.had a great time tonight!!"Its only illegal if you get caught, assuming you're stupid enough to get caught in the first place"."You don't seem to annoy me as much as usaul, but are you sure thats a deficite??".i hate the new facebook. it sucks.there are two kinds of people who sit around think about murder all day.bets you can't guess what he is doing right now.
