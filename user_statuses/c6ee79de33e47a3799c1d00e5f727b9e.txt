Feeling like crap, no temperature though so at least its not swine flu (at least I think its not!).Got a refferal to a ENT specialist so I can get a camera jammed up my nose into my sinuses. Not pretty but at least I may be able to finally get rid of this damn sinus infection! :D.Trying to send docs to the bank, and my personal advisor is not trusted with email or web access full access to my account, financial and personal, but not email *worry*.I think I must be doing something wrong on the trapeze, it feels like I have just went for a vasectomy after trying a few windmills yesterday. No pain no gain :).I have 1.6Kg of explosives for Nov 5 (The UK equiv of 4th July for the Americans), Hopefully with any luck this thing will make the night time look like daytime with the bang :D.Never had a crab, squid, musccle, scallop, and anchovie pizza before. It is however suprisingly good :).Hates facebook messaging, it always looks like you are waiting for the other person to message back, and then you see that it has infact timed out (again) and the person messaged back 6 hours ago. *sigh*.I know 6 sick people at the moment, and now I'm sick. I'm going to find out what one it was and come after them!! Watch yourselves ;).I love how much fun you can have with non newtonian fluids :D.The turkey is now officially drunk (Injected with enough alcohol that if we didn't eat it, it'd be at AA). Rubbed with secret spices, drizzled in bacon, and the silverside joint is slowly cooking for 7 hours. 15 Minute break then  back to cooking :D.Just hacked my appleTV, removed the WiFi chip and replaced with a broadcom H.264 hardware decoder chip. Now I can stream blu ray movies in 1080p from my fileserver to tv :D.Merry Christmas everyone :).Just made a spiced haddock on trimmed green bean and coconut rice with a coconut, chilli sauce... mmm.
