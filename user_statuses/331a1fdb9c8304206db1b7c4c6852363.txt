Almost killed myself trying to get a piece of non-existent parchment paper from my spider infested basement. Also, why would we buy Amish fruit salad? These are the questions.I can really see this Dislike button being abused for very ironic purposes... (Now, joy, I get to read Jane Eyre).In the process of trying to write a masterpiece! (oh, the vanity).Gonna read "SHF".Reading "A Clockwork Orange", and then on to "Slaughter-House five"...probably.Just slept from 7AM to 5PM @_@. Woops.Well, this poem MIGHT, loosely, imitate *PROPNAME*'s poem... Not sure I used enough imagery.Facebook is very hard to navigate with everything written like a pirate. I'll just have to adjust :).Watching a bunch of movies. I'm starting with "The Quiet Earth".
