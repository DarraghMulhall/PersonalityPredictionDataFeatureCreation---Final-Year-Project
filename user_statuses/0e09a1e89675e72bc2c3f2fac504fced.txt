Just bought a cute pair of purple pumps : ).Not yet - going to movies tonight...is sick in bed.  Coughing like and old hag and looking decidedly ropey : (.If you can't walk in heels take a taxi... Coco Chanel.I haven't opened the blinds yet but from the sound of the wind and the rain I think that the world may be about to end...is bloody freezing....Thanks everyone for all the texts etc...  Finally feeling human again!  I don't think I've ever been so sick.  Went out for the first time in 12 days this morning! Talk about cabin fever...  Back to work on Wednesday - am even looking forward to it!Typical, just when I'm finally able to go out again it's blowing a gale and bloody raining...I've finally arrived creaking into the facebook generation!  Hello everyone.
