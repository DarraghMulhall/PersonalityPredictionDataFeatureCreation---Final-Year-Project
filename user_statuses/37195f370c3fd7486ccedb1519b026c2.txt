is sick =(.Well, it finally happened: I bought a coffee so big it didn't fit in my microwave for re-heating. (Sub-status update: Go to bing.com for some major Boston pride ;-).The roof garden is born! Will post pics after a dinner made with our very own herbs =).hates saying bye to *PROPNAME*=(.Forty-five minutes on a Rittenhouse bench, with a bag full of veggies and La Colombe mocha, really turns the day around =).just had chicken McNuggets for dinner. This is a new low. And it's called "short call at CHOP.".Sick day today =(.Weekends go by so quickly... =(.No wonder *PROPNAME* *PROPNAME* *PROPNAME* dumped *PROPNAME*. His song about her is HORRENDOUS, even for a 90s ballad. Now I understand that *PROPNAME* is a (marginal) step up for her. *Shudder*.Thank you, Case Files. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't know what to expect when undergoing "The Menopause.".got a white Christmas of her own: hilltop house engulfed in a cloud all day! Thx for pulling through, St. John ;-).wishes the weekend would never end =).wouldn't mind if a Philly, NYC, or Boston friend posted pics of the snowy city to FB! C'mon, give a girl a white Christmas =).Kea: For the love of God, I am begging you to return those heinous Brooks Brothers shirts. *PROPNAME*: Well your face is heinous. And I don't ask you to return THAT. (Just another morning's playful banter between someone studying for Step 1 and someone fighting off an awful cold...).Finally caved and saw Avatar. As I suspected, real life now looks bland and 2-D. =//.just completed her night cheese ;-).1. Kea: a) one who has an excessive amount of cool b) a verb showing that someone is doing something sick c) a person filled with self-loathing for actually following this FB fad.
