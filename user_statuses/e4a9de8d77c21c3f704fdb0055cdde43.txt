Best newly discovered unhealthy snack disguised as a healthy one: yogurt-covered raisins  :D.Going through everyone's status messages from last night... yeah, so maybe I didn't do anything sexy or fun but I was at an event so >:P.Wow, even in 1963, *PROPNAME* was ranting about the "half-wit morons up in Sacramento" (just watch It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World).Just to be clear: Life is just a bowl of RAINIER cherries.  :D.Ears are being blown out by two trombone players... sure, they're classically trained and playing Holst's "Mars, the Bringer of War", but it HURTS.  :P.Any one have any clue as to what the new novelty fried fair food is going to be this year???  What was at the OC county fair?  I'm plotting my plan of attack at the State Fair...  ;).Devising ways to oust the old tenant out of *my* new place.  Not too happy that he's choosing to take another week to move out.  >:P.This hair-brainedness needs to cease... NOW.  :P.MMmmmmmm Trader Joes tart frozen yogurt... makes a mouth VERY happeh!!  :D.Going to have to severely restrain my impulse to gallop around the State Fair, squealing at the top of my lungs with glee.  :D.Missed the forest and smacked into a couple of the trees while I was at it too.  :P.Pipe dream for the day: Being a Wagnerian soprano.  I can shriek but not in tune.  :P.
