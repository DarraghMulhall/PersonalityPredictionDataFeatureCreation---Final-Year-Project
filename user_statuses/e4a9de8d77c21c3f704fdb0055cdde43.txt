Best newly discovered unhealthy snack disguised as a healthy one: yogurt-covered raisins  :D.Going through everyone's status messages from last night... yeah, so maybe I didn't do anything sexy or fun but I was at an event so >:P.Wow, even in 1963, *PROPNAME* was ranting about the "half-wit morons up in Sacramento" (just watch It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World).Just to be clear: Life is just a bowl of RAINIER cherries.  :D.Amadeus is quite possibly the most perfectly made movie *ever*...  director's cut bits add even more to the perfection.Ears are being blown out by two trombone players... sure, they're classically trained and playing Holst's "Mars, the Bringer of War", but it HURTS.  :P.32 days til the State Fair!  You better believe I have a count down going!!Any one have any clue as to what the new novelty fried fair food is going to be this year???  What was at the OC county fair?  I'm plotting my plan of attack at the State Fair...  ;).Devising ways to oust the old tenant out of *my* new place.  Not too happy that he's choosing to take another week to move out.  >:P.This hair-brainedness needs to cease... NOW.  :P.MMmmmmmm Trader Joes tart frozen yogurt... makes a mouth VERY happeh!!  :D.Going to have to severely restrain my impulse to gallop around the State Fair, squealing at the top of my lungs with glee.  :D.Already sleepy time again...  I blame lunch from Bread Store.Missed the forest and smacked into a couple of the trees while I was at it too.  :P.Nothing personal against you all as a species, ants, but mi casa es just not su casa.How did a non-coffee drinker like me end up hooked on cappuccinos?Okay Bears... Channel that anger and use it to cream the competition next week.Allergy season for *PROPNAME* is commencing...  *hack*hack*hack*   :P   I'm not contagious, promise!Pipe dream for the day: Being a Wagnerian soprano.  I can shriek but not in tune.  :P.Sorry, People magazine... your "sexy" guys can't hold a candle to the men of the 40s, 50s and 60s... *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*...Stupid PC... seriously asking to get chucked out the window.  But in the spirit of the season, it shall be spared.First there was TIGER; then TIGGER; and now LUST.  The alphabet soup of federal bureaucrats never ceases to amuse me.  And how ironic LUST stands for so-not-sexy "Leaking Underground Storage Tanks".I'm not quite sure how I feel about having my singing voice compared to *PROPNAME* (especially when the boyfriend makes the comparison).Does it count as a new years resolutiion to resolve to watch every episode of a TV series?Cold weather, lack of sunshine and fog all breed pestilence... Everything seems to be taking a quick swing at me too -- never taking up residence (knock on wood), but slowly trying to knock me out with a few quick jabs and sucker punches.
